# Improved Interface (Optional)

Here are a few things we did to improve our interface and the functionality of our application:

1) Improvising our Search functionality : We have prepared a reverse index where every entity points to the document ids in which they occur. This would enable a faster search experience when we have a really big corpus and a lot of entities

2) Improvising our front-end of the interface: 

- We made use of bootstrap to increase the look and feel of the Application

- We added a few additional components like Table, Drop down and BC Courts Logo next to Title to give it a nice touch

- All the documents with entities that the user requests will be displayed along with limited context around the entity and each entity itself will be highlighted in different colors to make it easier to differentiate among multiple entities

3) Enabling Multi Search functionality on front end :

- We let the users to enter search queries for multiple entities in one go

    - To implement the above, we used 'add' and 'remove' button on our interface which allows the user to add and entity search or remove one
    
4) Used Pagination to display the search results table, where the user can select the number of documents he wants to display at a time.

5) We also give users a "Search" option to further filter results based on keywords from the search results, not just the entity text, but the document text.
